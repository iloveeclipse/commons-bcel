              Apache Commons BCEL 6.0 RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Commons BCEL team is pleased to announce the commons-bcel6-6.0 release!

The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) is intended to give users a convenient
way to analyze, create, and manipulate compiled .class files. Classes are
represented by objects containing all the symbolic information of the given
class: methods, fields and byte code instructions.

BCEL 6.0 is a major release supporting the new features introduced in Java 6, 7
and 8. 

It requires Java 7 or higher to run.


Compatibility with 5.2
----------------------

Binary compatible - No

Source compatible - Yes, sort of;
 - Maven coordinates update:
    org.apache.bcel:bcel:5.2 -> org.apache.commons:commons-bcel6:6.0

 - Rename package imports: 
    org.apache.bcel -> org.apache.bcel

 - The org.apache.bcel.classfile.Visitor interface has been enhanced with
   additional methods. If you implemented it directly instead of extending
   the EmptyVisitor class you'll have to implement the new methods.

Semantic compatible - Yes, except:
 - BCEL handles new attributes such as code annotations that could only
   be processed by implementing a custom AttributeReader in the previous
   versions. Code relying on this behavior will have to be adjusted since
   the AttributeReader will no longer be called in these cases.
